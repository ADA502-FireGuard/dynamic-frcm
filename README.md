## <span style="color:tomato"> Installation </span>

To install the program for this project, we need to download/pull the docker image from DockerHub.

After downloading the Docker image, we can set up and run the program/application on localhost.

### <span style="color:tomato">Step 1: Open Docker Desktop</span>

First, open [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). 

(Docker needs to be running in the background.)

### <span style="color:tomato">Step 2: Open a terminal window</span>

Launch your terminal of choice.

You can type "cmd" in a Windows search bar to find the embedded command-line interface on Windows devices (alternatively press Windows key + R, type "cmd", and hit enter.)

### <span style="color:tomato">Step 3: Pull the project from Docker</span>
Next, we need to download the project from Docker.

In your terminal window of choice, write the following command:
```
docker pull xxx
```
image

### <span style="color:tomato">Step 4: Check Docker images on your local machine</span>
The project's Docker image should now be on your computer. 

To confirm this, run the following command in your terminal window:

```
docker images
```
image

### <span style="color:tomato">Step 5: Check the Docker Desktop Application</span>
In the Docker application, we should now be able see the project image in the image folder:
